    <p>
        Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.
        Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a
        galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.
        <br>
        It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially
        unchanged.
        <br>
        It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more
        recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
